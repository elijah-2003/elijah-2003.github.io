                <h3>Dual Path RNN Time-Domain Single-Channel Guitar String Separation</h3>
                <p>
                    Leveraging the concept of Domain Adaptation (Domain Shift), I employed an existing voice separation model, originally trained on the WSJ0 dataset. This dataset comprises 141 hours of speech recordings from 123 speakers reading excerpts from the Wall Street Journal. Utilizing a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06379" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dual Path RNN</a> and TasNET encoder and decoder, I encoded the audio, performed separation in a latent space, and produced source-separated audio in the feature space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project demonstrated a successful application of transfer learning by training the human voice separation model on MIDI guitar data. To enhance the model's performance, further training was conducted using a diverse set of guitar songs. Additionally, a classifier was trained to determine whether a note originates from a specific string of interest. For noise reduction in the generated samples, signal processing techniques such as DFT Filtering were employed to manually silence background noise, thereby isolating and deamplifying the string of interest.

                <p>
                    This project is a basic LISP interpreter implemented in Python, supporting a subset of the Scheme programming language. It includes tokenization, parsing, evaluation, and error handling. Users can evaluate Scheme expressions in real-time through an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key features include tokenization of source code, constructing a syntax tree, interpreting the syntax according to Scheme rules, and error handling. The interpreter manages variable mappings, supports user-defined functions, and implements basic Scheme functions such as arithmetic operations and list manipulation.

                    During this research project, high school students were guided in using Pandas and Seaborn to analyze data on Environmental Justice, Food Insecurity, and Housing in Boston. To address the gap in computing curricula for African American students, a custom functions class was created to make data extraction accessible. This effort was part of "liberatory computing" to empower students to combat racism through computing. The students developed impactful data visualizations and ArcGIS stories for a humanitarian organization, engaging in data activism initiatives with community organizations. These projects included various forms of analysis and incorporated community perspectives for advocacy, such as policies addressing flooding in low-income communities. Surveys showed increased awareness of data science's role in combating racism and enhanced proficiency in promoting racial justice. The research, culminating in a published paper sponsored by Black Issues in Computing Education (BICE), demonstrated how African American students can use data science to drive societal transformation by addressing systemic challenges through collaboration.
